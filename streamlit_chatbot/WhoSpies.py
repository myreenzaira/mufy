            ### üïµÔ∏è For the SPY:
            - You DON'T know the location (you're lost!)
            - Ask questions to figure out where you are
            - Try to blend in and not get caught
            - Use the location elimination tool to narrow down possibilities
            - Make a final guess when you're confident
            - Survive the vote to win!
            
            ### üîç For the DETECTIVES:
            - You KNOW the secret location
            - Ask questions to identify the confused spy
            - Don't make the location too obvious in your questions
            - Vote to eliminate the spy when you're ready
            - Work together to catch the impostor!
            
            ### ‚öñÔ∏è General Rules:
            - Game lasts 5 minutes ‚è∞
            - Take turns asking each other questions about the location
            - Questions should be location-related but not too obvious
            - Any player can start the elimination vote
            - All votes are completely anonymous ü§ê
            - **SPY WINS:** If time runs out OR if a detective gets eliminated
            - **DETECTIVES WIN:** If they successfully eliminate the spy
            
            ### üéØ Pro Tips:
            - Spies: Listen carefully to answers for location clues
            - Detectives: Watch for players giving vague or confused answers
            - Everyone: Be creative with your questions!
